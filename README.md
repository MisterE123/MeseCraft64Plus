Textures for Mesecraft

**Contributing:**

*Palette*:
Use The palette earth_vibes
https://lospec.com/palette-list/earth-vibes

*General Texturing guidelines*: (subject to revision)

1) use shading, using similar colors to indicate shadow over areas.

2) do not make textures too flat; use a variety of colors and shadow where possible. Also, use color blocking; that is, using solid areas/lines/patterns of colors, rather than random-noise-based texturing where possible.

3) do not stray from the palette; or get special permission to do so. Use alpha mixing sparingly or not at all if possible within a texture

4) textures for objects that are items-only, should, in general, have a dark outline around the texture.
